  </summary>

  ### [Setup an OAuth App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/)

    1. Sign in to GitHub Enterprise
    2. Go to "Settings" > "Developer settings" > "OAuth Apps"
    3. Click "New OAuth App"

       * Authorization callback URL: `https://github.com/blakebuthod/codeowners-helper`

    5. A **client id** and **client secret** will be generated

  ### [Retrieve an OAuth Token](https://developer.github.com/enterprise/2.18/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/#web-application-flow)

  1. Go to this URL in your browser: `http(s)://[HOSTNAME]/login/oauth/authorize?scope=repo&client_id=[CLIENT_ID]`
  2. It will redirect you (based on the value used for "Authorization callback URL") and at the end of the URL will be: `?code=...`
  3. Make a `POST` request with that code:

       * URL: `http(s)://[HOSTNAME]/login/oauth/access_token`
       * Body:

         ```json
         {
           "client_id": "[CLIENT_ID]",
           "client_secret": "[CLIENT_SECRET]",
           "code": "[CODE]"
         }
         ```

  4. Your token key will be in the response:

     ```text
     access_token=[TOKEN_KEY]&scope=repo&token_type=bearer
     ```
